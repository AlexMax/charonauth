This is an in-tree fork of Mozilla's node-srp which is tailored for use in
implementing the charon authentication protocol.  However, seeing as the
original library was licensed to me under the MIT license.  I think the only
fair thing to do is to continue to make the the SRP implementation contained
in this directory available under the MIT license, in addition to the AGPLv3
that the rest of the tree is available under.
